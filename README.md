Puttering with React Native 

Nothing interesting... following this tutorial https://www.raywenderlich.com/247-react-native-tutorial-building-android-apps-with-javascript#toc-anchor-004

Note: had too many problems integrating the navigation library, and apparently it looks like garbage anyway, so used React Native Navigation instead (https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/before-you-start/)
